## What is the Single Responsibility Principle?

<p>
  The Single Responsibility Principle states, “Each software module or class should have only one reason to change“. In other words, we can say that each module or class should have only one responsibility. 

  So, with the help of SRP, the classes become smaller, cleaner, and, thus, easier to maintain.

## What is the Open-Closed Principle?

<p>
  The Open-Closed Principle States that Software entities, such as modules, classes, functions, etc., should be open for Extension but closed for Modification.
</p>

## What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?

<p>
  The Liskov Substitution Principle is a Substitutability principle in object-oriented programming Language. This principle states that if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T should be replaced with objects of type S.
</p>

## What is the Interface Segregation Principle?

<p>
  The Interface Segregation Principle states Clients should not be forced to implement any methods they don’t use. Rather than one fat interface, numerous little interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods, with each interface serving one submodule.
</p>

## What is the Dependency Inversion Principle?

<P>
  The Dependency Inversion Principle states that High-Level Modules/Classes should not depend on Low-Level Modules/Classes. Both should depend upon Abstractions. Secondly, Abstractions should not depend upon Details. Details should depend upon Abstractions.
