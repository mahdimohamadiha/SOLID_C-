## What is the Single Responsibility Principle?

<p>
  The Single Responsibility Principle states, “Each software module or class should have only one reason to change“. In other words, we can say that each module or class should have only one responsibility. 

  So, with the help of SRP, the classes become smaller, cleaner, and, thus, easier to maintain.
